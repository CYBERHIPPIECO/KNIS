Principles

The main purpose of interaction is to create a feeling of presence. Keep systems simple, and extend them using imagination

direct control of the avatar
constant input to maintain the illusion
agreeable action outcome
deterministic mechanics (ability to plan ahead)
hidden actions (unlockable, not visible initially - new option bubbles)
no repetitions
consistency
responsive world
aesthetics matter
avoid fail-safes
local activities
